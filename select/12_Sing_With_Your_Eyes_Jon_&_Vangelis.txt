From the CD Single 'Wisdom Chain'
Sing With Your Eyes
Don't be afraid look at me
Sing with your eyes
What you see with your heart
Now don't be shy speak to me
Deep in your soul the three words
I love you
Other nights come back to you
Other times they follow you
See the moon it's been out
Many times
Many times
Does the sun forget the world
See the sun begin the day
Some are born
Some are loved
Some are lost and alone
Don't be afraid hold on to me
Sing with your eyes
What you feel with your heart
Think with your dreams
Don't try to hard
All questions will float
Away and fly
Please be with me in every dream
Fly by my side I wait here forever
Don't be afraid hold on to me
Sing with your eyes
What you feel in your heart
