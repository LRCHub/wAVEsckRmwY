It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
And I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead
of the programme
I want you to be mine, lady
And to hold your body close
Take another step
into the no mans land
For the longest time, lady
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know?
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you
From your head to toe
Sing,
oh oh oh's
oh oh oh's
Louder
oh oh oh's
Sing,
oh oh oh's
This love is ablaze
I saw flames from the
side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a
couple of days
Until then,
we've got nothing to say
And nothing to know
But something to drink,
and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until are
roads are changed
Singing "we found love
in a local rave"
I don't really know what
I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out
then hope and pray
I told her my name and said
"it's nice to meet ya"
Then she handed me a
bottle of water
filled with tequila
I already know she's a keeper
Just from this
one small act of kindness,
I'm in deep if anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home
but I've drunk all of it now
Not sobering up
we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another
Now she's kissing my mouth
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know?
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you
From your head to toe
Sing,
oh oh oh's
oh oh oh's
louder
oh oh oh's
Sing,
oh oh oh's
Can you feel it?
All the guys in here
don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music
from the back
Can you feel it?
I found you hiding here
so won't you take my hand
darling until the beat
kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Sing,
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know?
Sing,
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you
From your head to toe
Sing
