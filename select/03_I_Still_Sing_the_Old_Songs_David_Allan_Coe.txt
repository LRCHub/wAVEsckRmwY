Grandpa, i've been thinking about you lately
Wondering if you'd found peace of mind
I guess you'd be proud to know your grandsons
Never crossed that mason-dixon line

And i still sing the old songs that you taught me
And i still pray to jesus now and then
And just like you i wish that he would save me
To see the day the south will rise again

Daddy wore his purple heart so proudly
Long before i turned into a man
Buried with our flag across his casket
I was still too young to understand

Mama spent her last years in the garden
While i took my turn behind the gun
Lord, i'd give my life to find the freedom
Lost within the old songs that you sung

And i still sing the old songs that you taught me
And i still pray to jesus now and then
And just like you i wish that he would save me
To see the day the south will rise again
