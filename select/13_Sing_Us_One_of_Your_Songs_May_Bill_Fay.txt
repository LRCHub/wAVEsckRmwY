Sing us one of your songs, May
The ones you know so well
Sing us one of your songs, May
You know we love you well
Dry the tears from your eyes, May
What's it gonna be?
For you know he's gone to heaven, May
Though he was only 23

They say he was a brave one, May
And we all here agree
There never was a finer one, May
That died for his country

Sing us one of your songs, May
The ones you know so well
Sing us one of your songs, May
You know we love you well
Dry the tears from your eyes, May
What's it gonna be?
For you know he's gone to heaven, May
Though he was only 23

They say he was a brave one, May
And we all here agree
There never was a finer one, May
That died for his country

Sing us one of your songs, May
