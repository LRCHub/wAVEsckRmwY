[00:03.79] Wait a second, let me catch my breath
[00:09.24] Remind me how it feels to hear your voice
[00:14.70] Your lips are movin', I can't hear a thing
[00:20.21] Livin' life as if we had a choice
[00:25.79] Anywhere, anytime
[00:28.51] I would do anything for you
[00:34.13] Anything for ya
[00:36.80] Yesterday got away
[00:39.53] Melodies stuck inside your head
[00:44.95] A song in every breath
[00:47.80] Sing me to sleep now
[00:52.72] Sing me to sleep
[00:57.62] Oh, won't you sing me to sleep now?
[01:03.45] Sing me to sleep
[01:11.45] 
[01:31.22] Remember me now, time cannot erase
[01:36.76] I can hear your whispers in my mind
[01:42.20] I've become what you cannot embrace
[01:47.29] Our memory will be my lullaby
[01:52.95] Sing me to sleep now
[01:58.08] Sing me to sleep
[02:02.89] Oh, won't you sing me to sleep now?
[02:09.05] Sing me to sleep
[02:17.05] 
[02:36.44] Any-anytime
[02:39.34] I would do-do-do-do-do
[02:42.04] Time away
[02:44.84] Yesterday-day-day-day
[02:47.58] Any-anytime
[02:50.34] I would do-do-do-do-do
[02:53.21] Time away
[02:55.67] Yesterday-day-day-day
